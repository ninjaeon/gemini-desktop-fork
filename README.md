# Google-Gemini Desktop Client (Electron)
I've developed a straightforward desktop client for Google Gemini (formerly Bard) using the Electron framework.

This client operates by utilizing a WebView container to access the Gemini website and implements various modifications for enhanced user experience.
With the shortcut Ctrl + G, Gemini can be opened from anywhere.
tip: use the installer and copy the shortcut from the desktop to the startup folder.
